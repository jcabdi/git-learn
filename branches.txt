Branches in git is a powerful concept, instead of keep working on the main branch (which we could think of as the branch having the final product),
we may add or change contents using branches. When we make a new branch we are putting in the new created branch the actual content of main in the
moment we created this new branch. Now we can add or modify content and all the changes are going to be taking place inside the new branch and main
remain the same.

- to create a new branch and switch to it we can:

git branch <new-branch-name>
git switch <new-branch-name> or git checkout <new-branch-name>

or

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

- to list our branches:

git branch (an * is going to be in the branch we are on)

- to switch between branches once created we can:

git switch <branch-name>

or

git checkout <branch-name>
